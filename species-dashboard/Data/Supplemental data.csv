Fisheries Info,ALL,All Species,1,"<p>The fisheries resource is the bedrock of the Irish seafood industry. The waters around Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds and biologically sensitive areas in the EU. In 2010 an estimated 1.3 million tonnes of fish were taken by the fishing fleets of EU member states from the waters around Ireland (ICES Sub-areas VI & VII). Ireland landed 259,500 tonnes of these fish or 23% of the international landings. The main fish species caught were mackerel, horse mackerel, boarfish, blue whiting, herring, cod, whiting, haddock, saithe, hake, megrim, anglerfish, plaice, sole and Nephrops.<br/> <p><b> Main map: </b>This map shows the main fishing grounds arounds Ireland. The names of the grounds are based on records from fisheries observers and the outlines are derived from VMS data. The colour of the background uses a gradient to give the impression of water dept with the darker the colour indicating the deeper the water. The character of the seabed can vary considerably from one area to the next and fishers distinguish fishing grounds based on the bottom type and on the expected catch composition. Marine Institute fisheries observers record the names used for these grounds and although the names may vary between fishers and some grounds have no clear boundaries, patterns emerge when the observer records are overlaid over fishing effort data from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and catch composition data from the logbooks.</br>","<p>Fish are landed into numerous ports around the Irish coast and, although each vessel is registered in a single port, they do not necessarily land their fish there. The main landings port for each vessel was determined by examining logbook data from  Irish Logbook Database and selecting the port where most landings events took place. Only vessels greater than 10m with at least 50 landings events during the period 2008-12 were included.</p>",<p><b>Map:</b> The small map above shows the main Irish fishing ports (black dots). Minor ports are shown as white dots.</p>,"<p>From VMS data, it can be estimated that demersal otter trawlers account for the vast majority of fishing effort of vessels greater than 15m inside the Irish EEZ (around 62% of the fishing hours in 2008-12). Longliners account for around 15% and Gill and trammel netters for 7%. It is worth noting, however, that the time spent engaged in fishing operations is not necessarily a good measure of effort for passive gears. Pelagic trawlers only account for 5% of the total effort inside the EEZ but they are responsible for more landings than any other gear type, both in terms of volume and value. Beam trawlers and seiners account for around 5% and 2% respectively and pots and dredges both account for around 1%. Note that there are a considerable number of vessels<15m involved in potting and dredging. Other fishing gears or unknown gears account for the remaining 2%.</p>",<p><b> Map: </b>This map illustrates the nationality of vessels >15m fishing in the Irish EEZ (all gears combined). IRL = Ireland; GBR = United Kingdom; FRA = France; ESP = Spain; BEL = Belgium. The percentages in the legend refer to the share of the total effort inside the EEZ for each country.</p>,"<p>The VMS data also reveal that the vast majority of fishing effort by Irish vessels >15m takes places within the Irish EEZ (77%). However, most of the fishing effort inside the Irish EEZ is carried out by foreign vessels; Ireland is responsible for only 36% of the international effort of vessels >15m inside the EEZ (note that the proportion of Irish effort would be considerably higher if smaller vessels were included). The Irish effort consists of mainly of demersal otter trawlers. Spain accounts for 30% of the effort (mainly demersal otter trawlers and longliners). France and the UK account for 20% and 11% of the effort(dominated by demersal otter trawlers for both countries). Belgium accounts for 1% of the effort, (nearly all beam trawlers). The remaining 3% effort  is mainly carried out by the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark and is dominated by pelagic trawlers.<p>",<p><b> Map: </b>This map illustrates the spatial distribution of fishing effort by gear type for vessels >15m fishing in the Irish EEZ.

In order to assess the state of any fish stock, it is important to know the age structure of the population. The age profile gives an indication on how healthy the stock is. A broad range of ages signifies a healthy stock; a lack of young fish could mean poor spawning in a particular year; a lack of older fish may signify overfishing. </p> <p><b>How do we age fish? </b>The most common method used to age marine fish is to examine the ear stones or <u>otoliths</u> found in the head of the fish. These are made of calcium and help the fish to maintain its balance.</p> 

","<p>Otoliths provide an accurate representation of the age of the individual fish, as it consists of layers of calcium carbonate that are built up on an annual basis, much like tree bands. Each year of growth is composed of an opaque and a translucent zone. The opaque zones are wide and represent summer growth, when food is plentiful and the temperatures are warm. The translucent zones are narrower and represent winter growth, when food is less plentiful and temperatures are colder. The age of an individual fish can be determined by reading the pattern of zones on the otolith.The otoliths are located beside the brain in the head of the fish. Each species of fish has different shaped otoliths. Otoliths in plaice, mackerel and herring are thin and the bands are clear and easy to count. The otoliths of cod, haddock, whiting and black sole are thick and the otolith must be sectioned before the ring pattern can be seen.</p>",,,"<p>Data collection is essential for the implementation of the CFP.  Robust scientific data is required to evaluate the state of fish stocks, the profitability of the different segments of the sector and the effects of fisheries and aquaculture on the ecosystem. It is also used to evaluate EU policies: fisheries management measures, structural financial measures in support of the fisheries and aquaculture dependent areas, mitigation measures to reduce negative effects of fisheries on the ecosystem.","<p><b>Catch Sampling:</b> Scientists collect essential data for fish stock assessments when fishers land their catch. Additionally, sampling at sea allows scientists to quantify the part of the catch that is not landed at the ports. They estimate the amounts of fish that are landed or discarded, and collect age and length data.By sampling the commercial catches we collect crucial data on the amount of fish that is caught as well as their age and length composition of the fish. Many fish species can be aged; this information allows assessment models to track the abundance of cohorts of fish over time and analyse the age composition of the catch each year. These data are the raw material used to assess the resource.",<p> This map shows the positions of the hauls from which discards have been sampled 
Fish Species,COD,Cod,2,"<p>Atlantic cod  (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) around Ireland are very fast growing and attain lengths in excess of 35cm in the first year and over 90cm as adults. An average of 51cm  was found on <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a>. About 50% of individuals are mature at 2 years and virtually 100% are mature by 3 years of age. Juveniles are more commonly found from 30 to 80 m, mainly on rocky bottoms. Their diet consists of benthic animals, crustaceans and small fish. Fish become more prevalent in the diet in older cod. Once mature, an adult female can produce over 2 million eggs (about 500 eggs per gram of fish).</p>","<p>Cod  are widely distributed on both sides of the north Atlantic.

Fish Species,BOC,Boarfish,3,"<p>Boarfish (<i>Capros aper</i>)  are small, pelagic, plankton eating, shoaling species, found at depths of 0 to
600 m. The diet of boarfish consists primarily of zooplankton esp copepods, but also mysids and euphausiids.  Boarfish recruit to the fishery around three to four years of age, although they are a fairly slow growing longlived species and the
maximum age of boarfish is about 30. Spawning occurs on the Celtic Sea shelf edge
during June and July. Under optimal conditions, boarfish are capable of spawning over
an extended period of time. Maturation occurs at 3.5 years, corresponding to a total
length of approximately 10 cm. The maximum size of this species is about 18 cm.
On the Irish groundfish survey their mean length is 10 cm and their max length is less than 20cm.   Boarfish does not appear to be an important prey species in the Celtic Sea area.</p>","<p>Boarfish are widely distributed from Norway to Senegal, including the
Mediterranean and oceanic island waters, but mostly south of Ireland to north Spain. Although the stock definition is not well understood, it is assumed that boarfish caught on the ground fish survey belong to a stock that stretches from the Bay of Biscay to the North Sea.  Boarfish is a pelagic shoaling species and they are widely distributed at depths from the surface to 600m. On the ground fish survey their average depth is ca. 150m  but they have been recorded up to 750m deep.</p>",,<p>No text available</p>,,,<p><b>Main map: </b> The distribution of boarfish landings by Irish vessels >15m from 2007 to 2018. </p>,,,"<p>Boarfish otoliths are not routinely read in the Marine Institute, although there were some read in 2010 and 2011.</p>",In recent years the fishery has taken place further south than during the earlier years of the fishery.,,,,
Fish Species,HAD,Haddock,4,"<p>Haddock (<i>Melanogrammus aeglefinnus</i>) Haddock live near the bottom on gravel, clay, or smooth, hard sand and are widespread
in the northern Atlantic. They occur mostly at bottom depths between 10 and 200m.
Haddock are moderately large gadoids with a diet consisting largely of benthic molluscs,
crustaceans, worms and small fish. Small haddock are important prey for saithe and large
cod.
The waters around Ireland provide important spawning and nursery areas for haddock.
Irish waters are at the southerly end of the distribution of haddock, allowing them to
grow fast and mature early. They reach a length of around 27cm after two years of
growth and most haddock are mature at age two. However, haddock are a coldadapted
species and warm winters have been linked to poor recruitment success.
All haddock stocks occasionally produce extremely large numbers of recruits, which can increase the stock size
dramatically. Maturity appears more dependent on age in females, but on length in males (Gerritsen, 2010). Fecundity is similar to that found in cod at c.500 eggs per gram gutted weight (i.e. approx. 150,000 eggs for a 31cm female haddock). The  <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a>captures a significant proportion of fish below the minimum commercial landing size (>90%), and is a valuable source of information for juvenile fish about to enter the fishery.</P>","<p>Haddock are found from Barents Sea to the Bay of Biscay in the NE Atlantic, and up to the Straits of Labrador off Canada. Haddock on the survey are mostly caught as juveniles to the west and throughout the Celtic Sea. Adult fish are found throughout the survey generally down to about 300m.</p>",,<p>No text available</p>,,,"<p><b>Main map:</b> The distribution of haddock landings by Irish vessels >15m from 2007 to 2018. Smaller vessels contribute around 8% of the total haddock landings, these vessels mainly operate near the south and south-west coast of Ireland. </p>",,,<p>Haddock otholiths are ruitinely aged in the Marine Institute.</p>,Haddock are caught in most areas between 50 and 200 metres depth.,,,,
Fish Species,HER,Herring,5,"<p>Herring (<i> Clupea harengus</i>)  are schooling fish
with a diet consisting largely of zooplankton, mainly copeopds. Fish reach a total
length of between 28 and 37 cm, depending on the stock. Herring are important prey
for cod, seals, whales, dolphins and indeed many predatory fish.  Herring reach full maturity by ages 2 or
3. They are not particularly fecund by the standards of other pelagic fish.They can reach 20cm in size in their first to second year, but then growth levels off very quickly and they rarely reach sizes over 30cm. The mean size of herring caught on the <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a> is 22cm, which corresponds to fish in their second year. Half of herring are mature in their second year and all are mature in their third year. Herring are benthic spawners, which means they deposit their eggs on the sea floor, in particular on gravel beds. Herring feed primarily on copepods, and they are an important prey species for larger fish such as hake but also for marine mammals .</p>","<p>Herring are widely distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic. The Celtic Sea is the southern limit of their distribution in the eastern Atlantic. The specimen caught on the Irish groundfish survey belong to two stocks, the Celtic Sea and VIIj stock and the VIa South and VIIb,c stock. Herring are a pelagic shoaling species that undergo localised migrations between spawning, feeding and overwintering grounds. Both stocks comprise autumn and winter/spring spawning components. Unusually for a
marine fish, eggs are deposited on the bottom in discrete spawning grounds or 'beds' <a href=""http://www.infomar.ie/documents/An_Inventory_Of_Irish_Herring_Spawning_Grounds_IFB_42_2013.pdf"">(David O'Sullivan, 2015) </a>  where the benthos is mainly gravel.
In the waters around Ireland the main spawning grounds for herring are off the
Donegal, Dunmore East and Cork Harbour. Juveniles are only found in the Celtic Sea and to the west of Ireland close to the coast. The average depth distribution of Herring on the groundfish survey is around 80m but they have been recorded in water depths of up to 255m.</p>",,<p>No text available</p>,,,"<p><b>Main map: </b>The distribution of herring landings by Irish vessels >15m from 2007 to 2018.  Smaller vessels contribute 5% of the total landings, these vessels mainly operate inshore in the northern Celtic Sea. Spawning aggregations of herring are targeted over a number of gravelly spawning grounds but they are also caught outside the spawning season over other bottom types. A map showing the location of thesese spawning ground locations can be found using the link below (David O'Sullivan, 2015). </p>",,,"<p>Herring otoliths are relatively easy to read. These otoliths are read whole by mounting them on black plastic trays and covering them with clear resin. Approximately 3,000 herring otoliths are read in the Marine Institute each year. </p>",Herring are caught mostly in Divisions 7.g and 6.aS.,,,,
Fish Species,HKE,Hake,6,"<p>Hake (<i>Merluccius merluccius</i>) are a more elongate, slender bodied member of the cod family (gadoids) than Atlandic cod, haddock or even whiting. A small tail fin relative to well developed dorsal and anal fins provides manouverability rather than high speed over a prolonged distance. Small needle like teeth reflect a predatory rather than foraging feeding habit. Living near the seabed, hake ambush prey in the water column during vertical migrations mainly at night. Adult hake mainly feed on fish and squid and can occur close to
the bottom as well as off the bottom. Prey items include crustacea and shift more towards squid and small fish as they mature. Despite considerable study, there is currently no internationally agreed ageing system for hake due to the difficulty in reading their bony structures. Growth rates however differ between males and females with the largest caught fish invariably being female. While the average length for male hake on the  <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a> is 34cm and 36cm for female, the maximum is 83cm and 130cm respectively. A significant amount of data from the survey is provided for fish below the commercial minimum landing size (MLS). <p>","<p>Hake are widely distributed throughout the north-east Atlantic, mostly between 70
and 370m depth. Hake has an eastern Atlantic range from Iceland and Norway down to NE Africa, and into the Mediteranean and Black Sea. Other hake species are found in the western Atlantic and along the Pacific east coast. Juveniles are mostly caught off the southwest coast where one of the two main nursery grounds is found, the other being in the Bay of Biscay. Adult fish are encountered generally in the central Celtic Sea out to the deeper survey waters along the shelf edge with a more localised distribution in the north, west of Scotland. On average hake catches have occurred at c.150m, but overall have been caught between 24m down to >750m on a number of additional deeper water sampling tows beyond the standard survey boundary.There is no evidence for the existence of multiple populations of hake in the northeast
Atlantic, so from a biological point of view this is considered to be a single
stock.</p>",,<p>No text available</p>,,,"<p><b>Main map: </b>The distribution of hake landings by Irish vessels >15m from 2007 to 2018. Vessels <15m land virtually no hake.

Fish Species,HOM,Horse Mackerel,7,"<p> Atlantic Horse Mackerel (<i>Trachurus trachurus</i>) is quite a long lived and slow growing species. On the groundfish survey the length of specimens ranges between 3 cm and 43 cm with a mean size of 26cm. This would correspond to a ca. 4 year old fish. Horse Mackerel are between 2 and 3 years old when they reach maturity for the first time. Once they are mature they produce and release several batches of eggs during one spawing season, the batches are around 50 000 eggs depending on the size of the female. Horse Mackerel is a filter feeder mainly ingesting zooplankton but also feeds on small fish such as juvenile whiting and herring.They are a relatively long lived
species that can live for more than 26 years. Large fluctuations in year class strength
are a feature of horse mackerel stocks. Maturity is reached between the ages of 2 and
4. The western stock spawns in the Celtic Sea in June, followed by a northerly feeding
migration. The stock may enter the North Sea from the north with abundance
associated with the influx of Atlantic water. The return migration takes place in late
autumn. Juveniles are pelagic feeders while larger individuals feed closer to the bottom,
mainly on 0-group fish. <p>","<p>Horse mackerel is a widely-distributed pelagic species, sometimes regarded as semipelagic
as they are often found near the seabed. Horse mackerel are widely distributed in the Eastern Atlantic (north and south),  the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The specimen caught on the Irish groundfish survey belong to the western horse mackerel stock, which is found along the European continental shelf between the Bay of Biscay and Norway. Horse mackerel is a pelagic species and can form dense shoals in mid to deep water. On the ground fish survey it is caught in depths of up to 750m but it has an average depth of 120m. Horse mackerel undergoes extensive migration between spawning, feeding and overwintering grounds. The groundfish survey catches juveniles and as well as adults.

Fish Species,MAC,Mackerel,9,"<p>Mackerel (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>) are fast growing with length of  ca 20 cm attainable after 1 year of growth. The sizes caught on the IGFS survey range between 13 and 43cm with a mean size of 26cm. This would correspondto a ca. 1 year old fish. Mackerel feed mainly on zooplankton such as copepods and on small fish such as sprat, small herring and Norway pout. They stop feeding during the winter.  Mackerel mature relatively fast with over 50% mature in their second year. Mackerel are batch spawners that release their eggs into the water column. A medium sized adult female produces ca. 500 000 eggs in a season.                                                                                              The Atlantic Mackerel is a widely distributed, migratory pelagic fish that inhabits
much of the north-eastern Atlantic shelf. It is streamlined and fast swimming,
forming dense shoals when migrating to spawning grounds to the south and west
of Ireland. Spawning takes place between February and July after which they
migrate north, disperse and feed. Diet depends on season but consists mainly of
zooplankton and juvenile fish. Juvenile mackerel grow rapidly and reach 30cm
after 2 years at which point more than half are mature. The majority of mackerel
caught on the  <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a> are between 4 and 8 years of age with individuals older than 15 rare.</p>",<p>Mackerel can be found in the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic.The Northeast Atlantic stock is distributed between the Iberian Penisnsula and the Norwegian Sea and is highly migratory.

abundant around 200-600m. Irish landings are nearly exclusively <i>L. whiffiagonis</i>.
Megrim have comparatively large mouths relative to other flatfish and their diet consists largely of small demersal fish, cephalopods and crustaceans.
Megrim are relatively slow growing and long-lived. Females grow larger, mature
later and live longer than males. Growth doesn't show the same stark slowing down associated with the onset of sexual maturity as in many other flatfish species. Males are sexually mature by about 5-6 years of age, whilst females mature a bit later at around 6-7yrs.

About 50% of the female fish are sexually mature by 9 years of age, but males mature younger at 5-6yrs for 50% maturity. Eggs are shed in long gelatenous ribons, 60-90cm wide and up to 9m long, which float in the water currents. Feeding is invariably by ambush on the seabed using a modified fleshy spine at the front of it's dorsal fin as a lure. It will consume virtually anything that crosses it's path and is recorded to feed in the water column or even attack seabirds at the surface in order to meet it's voracious appetite.The population structure is poorly understood but genetic diversity within the species appears to be limited.

About 50% of the female fish are sexually mature by 9 years of age, but males mature younger at 5-6yrs for 50% maturity. Eggs are shed in long gelatenous ribons, 60-90cm wide and up to 9m long, which float in the water currents. Feeding is invariably by ambush on the seabed using a modified fleshy spine at the front of it's dorsal fin as a lure. It will consume virtually anything that crosses it's path and is recorded to feed in the water column or even attack seabirds at the surface in order to meet it's voracious appetite.The population structure is poorly understood but genetic diversity within the species appears to be limited.
Anglerfish can migrate hundreds of kilometres and the eggs and larvae are pelagic for up to 4 months, allowing
them to be dispersed over large areas. Recruitment success varies strongly between years.</p>","<p> <i>Lophius budegassa</i> has a southern distribution from the British islands and Ireland to Senegal (including the Mediterranean and the Black Sea). Most survey catches are concentrated off the west and south west coasts as well as the commercial fishing grounds in the Celtic Sea south of Waterford.

Fish Species,PLE,Plaice,13,"<p>Plaice (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>) are found throughout the Atlantic coast of Europe and in
the western Mediterranean. They are usually found in waters less than 100m depth.
Older fish are found in deeper water. Plaice are most commonly found on sandy,
muddy or gravel bottom. Small fish are found in intertidal areas and there is evidence
to suggest homing behaviour.
The Irish Sea is an important spawning ground for plaice. Spawning occurs off the
bottom from February to April in the Irish Sea and is dependent on water
temperature. Males reach maturity between 2 and 6 years, and females between 3
and 7 years, with age at maturity again being dependent on water temperature.
Young plaice feed on small worms and shrimp. As they grow their diet becomes
more varied and they eat small crustaceans, crabs, mussels, scallops and shrimp.</p>","<p>Plaice are found from southern Greenland to Norway, south to Morocco, and east to the Mediteranean and White Sea. Juveniles (average length 12cm) are very small and found inshore in very shallow water so not commonly encountered on the survey.

Fish Species,POK,Saithe,14,"<p>Saithe is a large Gadoid, reaching maximum size of 130cm. It is a cold-water species distributed throughout the
northern Atlantic. Saithe live in shoals and occur close to the bottom, in midwater and even near the surface.
Juveniles occur mostly in coastal waters while older fish move to deeper waters. Tagging experiments have
shown that adults can migrate over considerable distances, indicating at least some exchange between the
Norwegian coast, Faroe and Iceland. <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a> data show that density in the north eastern North Sea is markedly higher during summer than during winter, suggesting dispersal during the feeding season.
Saithe feed primarily on pelagic organisms. Krill is the most important food for young fish, but is also consumed
by larger individuals. Larger fish mainly feed on capelin, sandeels and other fish species.

Fish Species,SOL,Sole,17,"<p> Black sole, also called Dover sole, (<i>Solea solea<i>) are flat fish which lie buried on sandy or muddy
seabed. They feed primarily at night on small crustaceans, worms and bivalve molluscs.
In common with many flatfish, sole are fast growing as juveniles, slowing down as they
mature. Females grow larger than the males. They can reach lengths of up to 70cm or
weights of up to 3kg. Sole are quite solitary marine and estuarine fish, and the local
environment may contribute to variable growth rates.
Females reach maturity by ca. 6yrs and an average mature female can produce in the
region of 150,000 - 200,000 eggs a year. They spawn in spring and early summer and
become mature at 3-6 years when they are around 25-30cm long. Juveniles are
found in the first 2-3 years in coastal nurseries before they move in to deeper waters.</p>","<p>Common sole (also called black or Dover sole) are found from Norway to west of Scotland in the north, down to Senegal in in the south, and east into the Mediteranean Sea.

Fish Species,WHG,Whiting,20,"<p>Whiting (<i>Merlangius merlangus</i>) are voracious feeders appearing in large shoals and feeding largely on
crustaceans and increasingly small fish. Their fine sharp teeth reflect the more
predatory diet hunting mobile prey in the water column. They are fast growing and
reach about 26cm in the first year at which stage about 60% are sexually mature. At
age 2 almost 100% of females and ~ 85% of males are fully mature. The growth rate
varies considerably in Irish waters. The slowest growth occurs in the Irish Sea while
the fastest growth off the west coast where the whiting can grow up to 70 cm.The minimum landing size (MLS) in whiting coincides with fish at essentially one year old.  A significant proportion of the <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-groundfish-survey"">Irish Groundfish surveys</a> catch is below this limit and therefore a useful source of data on juvenile survival and recruitment.

Fish Species,NEP,Nephrops,,"<p>Nephrops norvegicus is widely distributed on muddy substrates throughout
the north-east Atlantic from Iceland in the north to Morocco in the south.
Around Ireland they are found in depths from 20m to600m but mainly at
average depths of ~100 m on the shelf. They construct shallow burrows in
muddy sediments which limits the distribution. Nephrops larvae hatch late
spring/early summer. The females leave the burrows to hatch the eggs and
mate. The eggs take about 4-8 weeks to develop into juveniles depending on
water temperature. For the remainder of the year mature females then
spend the majority of time in their burrows first to spawn the eggs and then
incubate them. Male Nephrops are more active outside of the burrows
foraging for food.
Unlike fish, there is no direct way to age Nephrops. Growth rates vary considerably in different areas. Mean size
is negatively correlated with density of individuals. The maximum carapace length recorded for Nephrops is a
